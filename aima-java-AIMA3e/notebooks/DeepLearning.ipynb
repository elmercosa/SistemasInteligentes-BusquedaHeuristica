    "Recurrent neural networks are the networks that introduce the concept of time i.e they allow us to define the value of some variable $v$ at time step $t$ in terms of the values of this variable at previous time steps. For example, we can define an update rule: $v_{(t)} = f(v_{(t-1)})$ using some function $f$ of our choice. These networks are particularly well suited for sequence processing tasks as they allow us to operate over the **sequences of vectors**: sequences in the input, the output, or in the most general case both. In the last few years, there has been incredible success applying RNNs to a variety of problems such as speech recognition, language modeling, translation, image captioning and the list goes on. "

A tensor can have a shape with any number of dimensions. The number of dimensions in a tensor is usually referred to as its rank. So a scalar is a rank 0 tensor, a vector is a rank 1 tensor, a matrix is a rank 2 tensor, and so on and so forth.\n",

Subsequently, we can export a trained model and use that in Java using the TensorFlow Java API. This would particularly be useful for situations where we want to use machine learning enabled features in existing clients running on Java.
