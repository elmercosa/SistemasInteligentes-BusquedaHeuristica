    "Reinforcement learning refers to goal-oriented algorithms, which learn how to attain a complex objective (goal) or maximize along a particular dimension over many steps; for example, maximize the points won in a game over many moves. They can start from a blank slate, and under the right conditions, they achieve superhuman performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example of a problem of learning chess. A supervised agent needs to be told the correct move for each position it encounters, but such feedback is seldom available. Therefore, in the absence of feedback, the agent needs to know, that something good has happened when it accidentally checkmates its opponent and that something bad has happened when it gets checkmated. This kind of feedback is called a **reward** or **reinforcement**. Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer label with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of the training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, in game playing, it is very hard for a human to provide accurate and consistent evaluations of a large number of positions. Therefore, the program is told when it has won or lost, and the agent uses this information to learn a reasonably accurate evaluation function."

    "Let's have a look at some important concepts before proceeding further: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reward** ($R$): A reward is feedback by which we measure the success or failure of an agent’s actions. From any given state, an agent sends output in the form of actions to the environment, and the environment returns the agent’s new state (which resulted from acting on the previous state) as well as rewards if there are any. They effectively evaluate the agent’s action.\n",
    "* **Policy** ($\\pi$): The policy is the strategy that the agent employs to determine the next action based on the current state. It maps states to actions, the actions that promise the highest reward. The policy that yields the highest expected utility is known as an **optimal policy**. We use $\\pi^*$ to denote an optimal policy.\n",
    "* **Discount factor** ($\\gamma$): The discount factor is multiplied by future rewards as discovered by the agent to dampen these rewards’ effect on the agent’s choice of action. Why? It is designed to make future rewards worth less than immediate rewards. If $\\gamma$ is 0.8, and there’s a reward of 10 points after 3 time steps, the present value of that reward is 0.8³ x 10. A discount factor of 1 would make future rewards worth just as much as immediate rewards.\n",
    "* **Transition model**: The transition model describes the outcome of each action in each state. If the outcomes are stochastic, we write $P(s'|s,a)$ to denote the probability of reaching state $s'$ if the action $a$ is done in state $s$. We'll assume the transitions are **Markovian** i.e. the probability of reaching $s'$ from $s$ depends only on $s$ and not on the history of earlier states. \n",
    "* **Utility** ($U(s)$): The utility  is defined to be the expected sum of discounted rewards if the policy $\\pi$ is followed from that state onward."

    "In passive learning, the agent's policy $\\pi$ is fixed: in state $s$, it always executes the action $\\pi(s)$. Its goal is to learn how good a policy is - that is to learn a utility function $U^{\\pi}(s)$. Note that the passive learning agent does not know the transition model $P(s'|s,a)$, which specifies the probability of reaching state $s'$, from state $s$ after doing action $a$; nor does it know the reward function $R(s)$, which specifies the reward for each state. The agent executes a set of trials in the environment using its policy $\\pi$. In each trial, the agent begins from the start-position and experience a sequence of state transition until it reaches one of the terminal states. It's percept supply both the current state and the reward received in that state. The objective is to use the information about the rewards to learn the expected utility $U^{\\pi}(s)$ associated with each non-terminal state $s$. \n",

For a passive learning agent, this means plugging a learned transition model $P(s'|s,\\pi(s))$ and the observed reward $R(s)$ into the Bellman equation to calculate the utilities of states."

One might think that this causes improperly large changes in $U^\\pi(s)$, but, in fact, because rare transitions occur only rarely, the average value of $U^\\pi(s)$ will converge to the correct value.

A GLIE scheme must try each action in each state an unbounded number of times to avoid having a finite probability that an optimal action is missed because of an unusually bad series of outcomes. An agent using such a scheme will eventually learn the true environment model. There are several GLIE schemes, one of the simplest is to have the agent choose a random action a fraction $1/t$ of the time and to follow the greedy policy otherwise. While this does converge to an optimal policy, it can be extremely slow.

    "The final approach we'll consider here is the policy search. Policy-search methods operate directly on the representation of the policy, attempting to improve it based on the observed performance. As we know that, policy $\\pi$ is a function that maps states to actions, we are interested primarily in the parameterized representation of $\\pi$ that have far fewer parameters than there are states in the state space. For example, we could represent $\\pi$ by a collection of parameterized Q-functions, one for each action, and take the action with the highest predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\pi(s) = max_a\\hat{Q}_\\theta(s,a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy search adjusts the parameter $\\theta$ to improve the policy. But one problem with policy representation of this kind is that the policy is a discontinuous function of parameters when the actions are discrete i.e. there will be values of $\\theta$ such that an infinitesimal change in $\\theta$ causes the policy to switch from one action to another. This means that the value of the policy may also change discontinuously, which makes the gradient-based search difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, policy search methods often use a **stochastic policy** representation $\\pi_{\\theta}(s,a)$, which specifies the probability of selecting action $a$ in state $s$. One popular representation is the **softmax function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\pi_{\\theta}(s,a) = e^{\\hat{Q}_\\theta(s,a)}/\\sum _{a'}e^{\\hat{Q}_\\theta(s,a')}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax becomes nearly deterministic if one action is much better than the others, but it always gives a differentiable function of $\\theta$, hence, the value of the policy is always a differentiable function of $\\theta$.  "
