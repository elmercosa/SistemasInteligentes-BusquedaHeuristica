    "This notebook serves as a supporting material for Chapter 6 **Constraint Satisfaction Problems**. In this notebook, we demonstrate how the [csp package][1] can be used to solve problems that can be formulated as CSPs. We use **factored representation** for the states in a CSP. We will see that by deviating from the notion of atomic states, we can use general purpose inference techniques and search heuristics to solve any CSP. Hence, a CSP solver can be used to solve any problem once it has been formulated as a CSP. Let's begin by loading the `aima-core` jar file.\n",

    "Only constraint we will be using in the map coloring CSP is the *Alldiff* constraint. *Alldiff* constraint is a **global constraint** (constraint involving arbitrary number of variables) that restricts the variables to not take the same value. For e.g., let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be variables with the same domain $D_A=D_B=D_C=\\{1,2,5,6,7\\}$. Then, the constraint *Alldiff*$(A,B,C)$ can be enumerated as \n",

    "* **domains:** The domain of a variable includes various colors that the corresponding region can be colored with. In this case, all the variables have the same domain consisting of colors *red*, *green* and *blue*. That is, $D_i = \\{red,green,blue\\}$ for $i=1,2,...,7$.\n",
    "* **constraints:** Since any set of regions having a common boundary can't be of same color, we introduce the constraints *Alldiff*$(WA,NT,SA)$, *Alldiff*$(NT,SA,Q)$, *Alldiff*$(SA,Q,NSW)$ and *Alldiff*$(SA,NSW,V)$.

At next level, the branching factor is $(n-1)d$, and so on for the $n$ levels. We generate a tree with $n!.d^n$ leaves, even though there are only $d^n$ possible complete assignments. Note that, this formulation ignores a crucial property common to all the CSPs: **commutativity**. CSPs are commutative because when assigning values to the variable, we reach the same partial assignment regardless of the order. Therefore, we need to consider only a _single_ variable at each node in the search tree. With this restriction, the number of leaves is $d^n$, as we would hope."

However, the MRV heuristic doesn't help at all if all the variables have the same number of legal values left in their domains. In such cases, the **degree heuristic** comes in handy.

    "## The Structure of Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll examine the ways in which the structure of the problem can be used to find solutions quickly. For example, any _tree-structured CSP can be solved linear in the number of variables_(constraint graph is a **tree** when any two variables are connected by only one path). The key is the new notion of consistency called **directed arc consistency** or DAC. A CSP is defined directed arc-consistent under any ordering of variables $X_1, X_2,...., X_n$ if and only if every $X_i$ is arc consistent with each $X_j$ for $j>i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve a tree-structured CSP, first pick any variable to be the root of the tree, and choose an ordering of the variable such that each variable appears after its parent in the tree. Such an ordering is called a **topological sort**. Any tree with $n$ nodes has $n-1$ arcs, so we can make this graph directed arc consistent in $O(n)$ steps. Once we have a directed arc consistent graph, we can just march down the list of variables and choose any remaining value. Since each link from parent to child is arc consistent, we know that for any value we choose for the parent, there will be a valid value left to choose for the child. That means we don't have to backtrack; we can move linearly through the variables. Let's take a look at the pseudo code of this algorithm."

    "* Choose the subset S of the CSP's variables such that the constraint graph becomes a tree after removal of S. S is called a **cycle cutset**.\n",

    "* Every variable in the original problem appears in at least one of the subproblems.\n",

    "The first two conditions ensure that all the variables and constraints are represented in the decomposition. The third condition simply reflects the constraint that any given variable must have the same value in every subproblem in which it appears. We can solve each subproblem independently; if anyone has no solution, the entire problem has no solution. If we can solve all the subproblems, then we attempt to construct a global solution as follows. First, we view each subproblem as a \"mega-variable\" whose domain is the set of all solutions for the subproblem. The constraints between the subproblem simply insist that the subproblem solutions agree on their shared variables."
